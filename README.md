# Super Mario Google Doodle

This Google Doodle will have the pixel art of Super Mario using Tanooki Mario as the main character. Tanooki will come up out of the pipe on the left and begin to punch the blocks above to reveal each letter of "Google". As he punches a block, it will break and then reveal a letter. The last block is a question block that a mushroom will emerge from once hit. The mushroom will make Tanooki grow in size and the question block turns into a normal block which Tanooki will then hit and break it to reveal the final letter of "Google".
